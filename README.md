   - Each regular balloon gives you 10 points.

## Game Mechanics

### Balloons

- **Regular Balloons**: These balloons have no special properties and provide standard points.
- **Bonus Balloons**: These balloons have a 10% chance of appearing and can grant additional points or power-ups.

### Power-Ups

When players pop bonus balloons, they can receive various power-ups:

- **Extra Time**: Adds 5 seconds to the remaining time.
- **Slow Motion**: Temporarily slows down the balloon movement for 5 seconds.
- **Freeze**: Freezes balloons in place for 5 seconds, preventing them from escaping.
- **Double Score**: Doubles the player's score for 10 seconds.
- **Extra Life**: Grants an additional life, allowing players to continue playing.

### Lives

- Players start with **3 lives**. If a balloon escapes, a life is lost. The game ends when all lives are depleted.
- Players can collect power-ups that can restore or increase lives.

### Levels

- Players start at level 1. With every 10 combos of balloon pops, they advance to the next level, which increases the difficulty:
  - **Speed**: Balloons rise faster.
  - **Size**: Balloons become smaller and harder to click.

## Customization Options

### Themes and Styles

- You can customize the game's visual appearance by modifying the CSS styles:
  - Change balloon colors, backgrounds, and animations to create a unique visual experience.
  - Update the balloon emojis or images for different themes (e.g., Halloween, Christmas, etc.).

### Sound Effects

- To customize sound effects:
  - Replace the existing pop sound (`pop-sound.mp3`) with your own sound file while maintaining the same file format.

### Difficulty Settings

- You can adjust the game's difficulty settings by modifying the speed, balloon size, and power-up probabilities in the game logic.
